## Audience Score vs Critic Score

### Note about Rotten Tomatoes data

Rotten tomatoes doesn't publish data archives and is stingy with their api keys.
The data used here is from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/rotten-tomatoes-movies-and-critics-datasets) (temporarily mirrored [here](https://send.firefox.com/download/1dd68bdefb59f9e0/#vAsKiExvOYFg4zPTU6gK3w)).
It contains some guy's output from scraping rotten tomatoes 5 months ago and has 16,637 movies.
